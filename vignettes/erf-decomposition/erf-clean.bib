	Abstract = {{A new bulk microphysical parameterization for large-eddy simulation
   (LES) models of the stratocumulus-topped boundary layer has been
   developed using an explicit (drop spectrum resolving) microphysical
   model as a data source and benchmark for comparison. The liquid water is
   divided into two categories, nonprecipitable cloud water and drizzle,
   similar to traditional Kessler-type parameterizations. The cloud
   condensation nucleus (CCN) count, cloud/drizzle water mixing ratios,
   cloud/drizzle drop concentrations, and the cloud drop integral radius
   are predicted in the new scheme. The source/sink terms such as
   autoconversion/accretion of cloud water into/by drizzle are regressed
   using the cloud drop size spectra predicted by an explicit microphysical
   model. The results from the explicit and the new bulk microphysics
   schemes are compared for two cases: nondrizzling and heavily drizzling
   stratocumulus-topped boundary layers (STBLs). The evolution of the STBL
   (characterized by such parameters as turbulence intensity, drizzle
   rates, CCN depletion rates, fractional cloud cover, and drizzle effects
   on internal stratification) simulated by the bulk microphysical model
   was in good agreement with the explicit microphysical model.}},

@article{Zelinka2014,
	Abstract = {The interaction of anthropogenic aerosols with radiation and clouds is the largest source of uncertainty in the radiative forcing of the climate during the industrial period. Here we apply novel techniques to diagnose the contributors to the shortwave (SW) effective radiative forcing (ERF) from aerosol-radiation-interaction (ERFari) and from aerosol cloud interaction (ERFaci) in experiments performed in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. We find that the ensemble mean SW ERFari+aci of -1.40 +/- 0.56 W m(-2) comes roughly 25\% from ERFari (-0.35 +/- 0.20 W m(-2)) and 75\% from ERFaci (-1.04 +/- 0.67 W m(-2)). ERFari is made up of -0.62 +/- 0.30 W m(-2) due to aerosol scattering opposed by +0.26 +/- 0.12 W m(-2) due to aerosol absorption and is largest near emission sources. The ERFari from nonsulfate aerosols is +0.13 +/- 0.09 W m(-2), consisting of -0.15 +/- 0.11 W m(-2) of scattering and +0.29 +/- 0.15 W m(-2) of absorption. The change in clear-sky flux is a negatively biased measure of ERFari, as the presence of clouds reduces the magnitude and intermodel spread of ERFari by 40-50\%. ERFaci, which is large both near and downwind of emission sources, is composed of -0.99 +/- 0.54 W m(-2) from enhanced cloud scattering, with much smaller contributions from increased cloud amount and absorption. In models that allow aerosols to affect ice clouds, large increases in the optical depth of high clouds cause substantial longwave and shortwave radiative anomalies. Intermodel spread in ERFaci is dominated by differences in how aerosols increase cloud scattering, but even if all models agreed on this effect, over a fifth of the spread in ERFaci would remain due solely to differences in total cloud amount.},

	Abstract = {{Some of the global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gases is offset
   by increased reflection of solar radiation by clouds with smaller
   droplets that form in air polluted with aerosol particles that serve as
   cloud condensation nuclei(1). The resulting cooling tendency, termed the
   indirect aerosol forcing, is thought to be comparable in magnitude to
   the forcing by anthropogenic CO2, but it is difficult to estimate
   because the physical processes that determine global aerosol and cloud
   populations are poorly understood(2). Smaller cloud droplets not only
   reflect sunlight more effectively, but also inhibit precipitation, which
   is expected to result in increased cloud water(3,4). Such an increase in
   cloud water would result in even more reflective clouds, further
   increasing the indirect forcing. Marine boundary-layer clouds polluted
   by aerosol particles, however, are not generally observed to hold more
   water(5-7). Here we simulate stratocumulus clouds with a fluid dynamics
   model that includes detailed treatments of cloud microphysics and
   radiative transfer. Our simulations show that the response of cloud
   water to suppression of precipitation from increased droplet
   concentrations is determined by a competition between moistening from
   decreased surface precipitation and drying from increased entrainment of
   overlying air. Only when the overlying air is humid or droplet
   concentrations are very low does sufficient precipitation reach the
   surface to allow cloud water to increase with droplet concentrations.
   Otherwise, the response of cloud water to aerosol-induced suppression of
   precipitation is dominated by enhanced entrainment of overlying dry air.
   In this scenario, cloud water is reduced as droplet concentrations
   increase, which diminishes the indirect climate forcing.}},

	Abstract = {Aerosol-cloud interactions are one of the most uncertain processes in climate models due to their nonlinear complexity. A key complexity arises from the possibility that clouds can respond to perturbed aerosols in two opposite ways, as characterized by the traditional ``cloud lifetime'' hypothesis and more recent ``buffered system'' hypothesis. Their importance in climate simulations remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the response of the liquid water path (LWP) to aerosol perturbations for warm clouds from the perspective of general circulation model (GCM) and A-Train remote sensing, through process-oriented model evaluations. A systematic difference is found in the LWP response between the model results and observations. The model results indicate a near-global uniform increase of LWP with increasing aerosol loading, while the sign of the response of the LWP from the A-Train varies from region to region. The satellite-observed response of the LWP is closely related to meteorological and/or macrophysical factors, in addition to the microphysics. The model does not reproduce this variability of cloud susceptibility (i.e., sensitivity of LWP to perturbed aerosols) because the parameterization of the autoconversion process assumes only suppression of rain formation in response to increased cloud droplet number, and does not consider macrophysical aspects that serve as a mechanism for the negative responses of the LWP via enhancements of evaporation and precipitation. Model biases are also found in the precipitation microphysics, which suggests that the model generates rainwater readily even when little cloud water is present. This essentially causes projections of unrealistically frequent and light rain, with high cloud susceptibilities to aerosol perturbations.},

Here, we simulate shallow warm clouds on 27 May 2011 at the southern Great Plains (SGP) measurement site established by the Department of Energy's (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program using a single-column version of a global climate model (Community Atmosphere Model or CAM) and a cloud resolving model (CRM). The LWP simulated by CAM increases substantially with aerosol loading while that in the CRM does not. The increase of LWP in CAM is caused by a large decrease of the autoconversion rate when cloud droplet number increases. In the CRM, the autoconversion rate is also reduced, but this is offset or even outweighed by the increased evaporation of cloud droplets near the cloud top, resulting in an overall decrease in LWP. Our results suggest that climate models need to include the dependence of cloud top growth and the evaporation/condensation process on cloud droplet number concentrations.},

	Abstract = {A new stratiform cloud scheme including a two-moment bulk microphysics module, a cloud cover parameterization allowing ice supersaturation, and an ice nucleation parameterization has been implemented into the recently developed GFDL AM3 general circulation model (GCM) as part of an effort to treat aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions more realistically. Unlike the original scheme, the new scheme facilitates the study of cloud-ice-aerosol interactions via influences of dust and sulfate on ice nucleation. While liquid and cloud ice water path associated with stratiform clouds are similar for the new and the original scheme, column integrated droplet numbers and global frequency distributions (PDFs) of droplet effective radii differ significantly. This difference is in part due to a difference in the implementation of the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen (WBF) mechanism, which leads to a larger contribution from super-cooled droplets in the original scheme. Clouds are more likely to be either completely glaciated or liquid due to the WBF mechanism in the new scheme. Super-saturations over ice simulated with the new scheme are in qualitative agreement with observations, and PDFs of ice numbers and effective radii appear reasonable in the light of observations. Especially, the temperature dependence of ice numbers qualitatively agrees with in-situ observations. The global average long-wave cloud forcing decreases in comparison to the original scheme as expected when super-saturation over ice is allowed. Anthropogenic aerosols lead to a larger decrease in short-wave absorption (SWABS) in the new model setup, but outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) decreases as well, so that the net effect of including anthropogenic aerosols on the net radiation at the top of the atmosphere (netradTOA = SWABS-OLR) is of similar magnitude for the new and the original scheme.},

	Abstract = {Changes in aerosol concentrations affect cloud albedo and Earth's radiative balance(1). Aerosol radiative forcing from pre-industrial time to the present due to the effect of atmospheric aerosol levels on the micro- and macrophysics of clouds bears the largest uncertainty among external influences on climate change(1). Of all cloud forms, low-level marine clouds exert the largest impact on the planet's albedo(2). For example, a 6\% increase in the albedo of global marine stratiform clouds could offset the warming that would result from a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations(3). Marine warm cloud properties are thought to depend on aerosol levels and large-scale dynamic or thermodynamic states(4-6). Here we present a comprehensive analysis of multiple measurements from the A-Train constellation of Earth-observing satellites, to quantify the radiative forcing exerted by aerosols interacting with marine clouds. Specifically, we analyse observations of co-located aerosols and clouds over the world's oceans for the period August 2006-April 2011, comprising over 7.3 million CloudSat single-layer marine warm cloud pixels. We find that thermodynamic conditions-that is, tropospheric stability and humidity in the free troposphere-and the state of precipitation act together to govern the cloud liquid water responses to the presence of aerosols and the strength of aerosol-cloud radiative forcing.},

@article{Mccoy2017,
	Abstract = {Aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) represent a significant source of forcing uncertainty in global climate models (GCMs). Estimates of radiative forcing due to ACI in Fifth Assessment Report range from -0.5 to -2.5 W m(-2). A portion of this uncertainty is related to the first indirect, or Twomey, effect whereby aerosols act as nuclei for cloud droplets to condense upon. At constant liquid water content this increases the number of cloud droplets (Nd) and thus increases the cloud albedo. In this study we use remote-sensing estimates of Nd within stratocumulus regions in combination with state-of-the-art aerosol reanalysis from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA2) to diagnose how aerosols affect Nd. As in previous studies, Nd is related to sulfate mass through a power law relationship. The slope of the log-log relationship between Nd and SO4 in maritime stratocumulus is found to be 0.31, which is similar to the range of 0.2-0.8 from previous in situ studies and remote-sensing studies in the pristine Southern Ocean. Using preindustrial emissions models, the change in Nd between preindustrial and present day is estimated. Nd is inferred to have more than tripled in some regions. Cloud properties from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are used to estimate the radiative forcing due to this change in Nd. The Twomey effect operating in isolation is estimated to create a radiative forcing of -0.97 +/- 0.23 W m(-2) relative to the preindustrial era.},

@article{Gryspeerdt2016,
	Abstract = {Aerosol-cloud interactions have the potential to modify many different cloud properties. There is significant uncertainty in the strength of these aerosol-cloud interactions in analyses of observational data, partly due to the difficulty in separating aerosol effects on clouds from correlations generated by local meteorology. The relationship between aerosol and cloud fraction (CF) is particularly important to determine, due to the strong correlation of CF to other cloud properties and its large impact on radiation. It has also been one of the hardest to quantify from satellites due to the strong meteorological covariations involved. This work presents a new method to analyze the relationship between aerosoloptical depth (AOD) and CF. By including information about the cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), the impact of the meteorological covariations is significantly reduced. This method shows that much of the AOD-CF correlation is explained by relationships other than that mediated by CDNC. By accounting for these, the strength of the global mean AOD-CF relationship is reduced by around 80\%. This suggests that the majority of the AOD-CF relationship is due to meteorological covariations, especially in the shallow cumulus regime. Requiring CDNC to mediate the AOD-CF relationship implies an effective anthropogenic radiative forcing from an aerosol influence on liquid CF of -0.48Wm(-2) (-0.1 to -0.64Wm(-2)), although some uncertainty remains due to possible biases in the CDNC retrievals in broken cloud scenes.},

@article{Lebsock2008,
	Abstract = {A global multisensor satellite examination of aerosol indirect effects on warm oceanic clouds is presented. The study centers on the water path response of cloud to aerosol burden. A unique element of the study is a rigorous rain screening methodology that is utilized to separate the responses of nonraining and raining clouds. It is demonstrated that high aerosol environments are associated with reduced liquid water path in nonprecipitating clouds and that the reduction in liquid water path reduces the albedo enhancement expected from decreasing effective radius. Furthermore the reduction in liquid water path is greater in thermodynamically unstable environments than in stable environments suggesting a greater sensitivity of cumulus cloud than stratiform cloud liquid water path to aerosol. In sharp contrast with nonprecipitating clouds, the cloud liquid water path of transitional and precipitating clouds increases dramatically with aerosol, which may be indicative of an inhibited coalescence process. The evidence further indicates that increasing aerosol requires greater amounts of cloud condensate before the onset of precipitation. Additional support for this hypothesis is found in a reduction in the probability of precipitation by as much as 10\% depending on the thermodynamical state of the environment. Independent estimates of the broadband cloudy-sky albedo are used to confirm that the cloud albedo responds to the trends that are identified in the liquid water path. In particular, it is found that the water path effect dominates the cloud albedo response for precipitating and transitional clouds. Finally, regional analysis demonstrates that the magnitude of the relationship between aerosol and cloud albedo is greatest in the extratropics and subtropical stratus regions primarily in the winter hemisphere. These relationships are used to estimate the magnitude of the first indirect effect as -0.42W/m(2).},

	Abstract = {A large number of processes are involved in the chain from emissions of aerosol precursor gases and primary particles to impacts on cloud radiative forcing. Those processes are manifest in a number of relationships that can be expressed as factors dlnX/dlnY driving aerosol effects on cloud radiative forcing. These factors include the relationships between cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration and emissions, droplet number and CCN concentration, cloud fraction and droplet number, cloud optical depth and droplet number, and cloud radiative forcing and cloud optical depth. The relationship between cloud optical depth and droplet number can be further decomposed into the sum of two terms involving the relationship of droplet effective radius and cloud liquid water path with droplet number. These relationships can be constrained using observations of recent spatial and temporal variability of these quantities. However, we are most interested in the radiative forcing since the preindustrial era. Because few relevant measurements are available from that era, relationships from recent variability have been assumed to be applicable to the preindustrial to present-day change. Our analysis of Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) model simulations suggests that estimates of relationships from recent variability are poor constraints on relationships from anthropogenic change for some terms, with even the sign of some relationships differing in many regions. Proxies connecting recent spatial/temporal variability to anthropogenic change, or sustained measurements in regions where emissions have changed, are needed to constrain estimates of anthropogenic aerosol impacts on cloud radiative forcing.},
